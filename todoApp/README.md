# Todo app

- More DOM interacton practice
- CSS Animations
- HTML Forms


## Planned features 
- [x] Users are shown an input box for which they can type a TODO item
- [x] When user hit "Enter" or select the "Add" button, it will add it to the list with a checkbox
- [ ] When the user clicks the checkbox, the todo item will get a strike through with cool animation
- [ ] When the todo item is added to list, it will play animation (TBD). Maybe a didn't animation each time? Random or cycled?
- [ ] User can search through all of their TODOs for sub strings
- [ ] User can click a button to generate a random TODO
- [ ] Maybe a todo tagging system?
